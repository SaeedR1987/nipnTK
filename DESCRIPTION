Description: An implementation of the National Information Platforms for Nutrition 
    (NiPN) analytical methods for assessing quality of anthropometric datasets that 
    include measurements of weight, height or length, MUAC, sex and age. The 
    focus is on anthropometric status but many of the presented methods could be 
    applied to other variables.
